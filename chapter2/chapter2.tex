\chapter{Related Works}  \label{ch:review}

In this chapter, I select the most outstanding studies based on a self-defined criteria (either published in a set of pre-selected venues or performed the highest impact by receiving at least fifty citations). To better introduce these papers in a well-organized manner, I categorize them into five following tracks borrowing ideas from aforementioned survey studies \cite{fortunato2010community, fortunato2016community, coscia2011classification}. In detail, papers in the Graph Type track focus on detecting communities in different types of graphs, such as heterogeneous or sparse graphs. In the Task track, the selected studies aim to solve particular tasks in community detection, such as deciding the correct number of communities. In the Methodological track, the introduced studies solve the general community detection problem via different types of model frameworks such as Modularity or spectral methods. In the Application track, selected studies discuss community detection applications and how to apply them to other disciplines. In the last Evaluation track, it lists papers to summarize the evaluation metrics widely used for model justification and comparison.
